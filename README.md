# SSH-Manager

This is a simple script that helps keep ssh accounts organized.

This prompts you for a user or PC Name to reference, the IP address, and ssh credentials.
Once entered it is stored in a powershell config file for quick connecting in the future.

This replaces the need to store certificates on the machine.
